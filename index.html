    <h1 id="title">TypeScript from JavaScrpit</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        TypeScript is a helpful programming language in web development. 
        TypeScript has all of the same functionality as JavaScript with some extra features.
        The biggest difference is that Typescript is strongly typed and allows for static typing while javascript does not.
    </p>
    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    <h4>Variables</h4>
    <p>
        Variables can be assigned by using the <strong>let</strong> keyword as shown below.
        You can also create a constant by using the <strong>const</strong> keyword.
        A constant's value cannot be changed.
        Typescript will infer the type of a vairable for you.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/Example_1.jpg" alt="code example"></div>
    <h4>Conditionals</h4>
    <p>
        Typecript supports <strong>if - else if - else</strong> trees for evaluating conditional values.
        Typescript has an equality comparion operater in '==' and an identity comparison operator in '==='.
        The difference between Javascript and Tyepscript here is that because strong typing is enforced both operators function similarly.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/Example_2.jpg" alt="code example"></div>
    <h4>Loops</h4>
    <p>
        A <strong>while</strong> loop executes code after checking if a condition is true.
        A <strong>do - while</strong> loop executes code before checking if a condition is true.
        A <strong>for</strong> loop can executes code using an iterator or for a certain number of iterations.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/Example_3.jpg" alt="code example"></div>
    <h4>Functions</h4>
    <p>
        Functions are defined using the <strong>function</strong> keyword followed by the function name and parenthesis that hold parameters and their types.
        If the function has a return value, the type of the return value is specified by the ':' symbol after the parameters.
        If the type of a parameter or return value is not specified it automatically gets the type 'any', but this is not good practice.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/Example_4.jpg" alt="code example"></div>
    <h2>In the Browser</h2>
    <p>
        To demonstrate running Typescript in the browser, I will use a simple script that changes some text in my webpage to different text when clicked.
        The code for that function can be found below.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/helloWorld.jpg" alt="helloWorld function"></div>
    <p>
        After writing the function I want to be included on my webpage, I need to add an event listener to my window for when the DOM (Document Object Module) is loaded.
        This only takes one line of code.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/window_listener.jpg" alt="window listener"></div>
    <p>
        This listener is activated when the DOM loads, which is basically when the webpage loads for the first time in a window.
        I pass the domLoaded function to this listener where I can specify what I want to happen when the page loads.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/dom_loaded.jpg" alt="dom loaded"></div>
    <p>
        I added an event listener to any element with the id "hello" that will run my helloWorld function when the element is clicked.
        You can see all of that code working with my example below.
        Try it for yourself!
    </p>
    <div class="helloFunction"><h3 id="hello">Click Me!</h3></div>
    <p>
        There are a few more steps you have to complete to actually get your code live.
        First, we have to convert our typescript to javascript.
        I do this by running the command `npm run compile`.
        After this we have to make sure our newly generated javascript file is included in our html file.
        I did this with the code below.
    </p>
    <div class="image"><img src="./img/html.jpg" alt="html"></div>
    <div id="footer">
        <span id="left">Ethan Raygor</span>
        <span id="center">Last Updated: 10/23/2022</span>
        <span id="right"><a href="./sources.html">Sources</a></span>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div id="helloScript"></div>
        <script>var exports = {}; </script>
        <script src="./js/main.js"></script>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
